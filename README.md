# Mechanical Keyboard Simulator

The sound of a mechanical keyboard has to be the most loved and hated feature of a Mechanical Keyboard, well, this program serves both, you can convert any keyboard into a mechanical one and get that soothing sound but when you or the people around you get irritated by its sound you can turn the volume down or completely switch it off, just the sound not the typing !
